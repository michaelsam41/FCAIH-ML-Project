ML Project: Regression &amp; Classification  California Housing: Predict median house values using KNN and Linear Regression. Oxford 102 Category Flower: Classify flower species using KNN and Logistic Regression. Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib.


Machine Learning Project: Regression and Classification
This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models on two datasets:

California Housing Dataset (Regression):
The project performs regression analysis on the California Housing dataset to predict the median house values for California districts. The models used include:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression
Linear Regression
Oxford 102 Category Flower Dataset (Classification):
The project applies classification techniques on the 102 Category Flower image dataset to classify flower species into one of the 102 categories. The classifiers used are:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing and Feature Scaling
Model Training, Testing, and Evaluation
Performance Comparison of KNN, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression
The project is built in Python using popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib for model evaluation and visualization.
